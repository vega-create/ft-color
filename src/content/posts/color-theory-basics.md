Color theory is the foundation of effective visual design. Understanding how colors interact helps you create harmonious palettes, evoke specific emotions, and communicate clearly.

## The Color Wheel

The color wheel organizes colors in a circle based on their relationship to each other. Primary colors (red, blue, yellow) cannot be created by mixing other colors. Secondary colors (orange, green, purple) are created by mixing two primaries. Tertiary colors are created by mixing a primary with an adjacent secondary.

## Color Relationships

### Complementary Colors

Colors opposite each other on the wheel create maximum contrast. Red and green, blue and orange, yellow and purple are complementary pairs. Use them to create visual impact and draw attention.

### Analogous Colors

Colors adjacent on the wheel create harmonious, cohesive palettes. They are pleasing to the eye and work well for backgrounds and supporting elements.

### Triadic Colors

Three colors equally spaced on the wheel create vibrant, balanced palettes. They maintain visual interest while remaining harmonious. Our palette generator supports all these schemes.

## Color Properties

Every color has three properties: hue (the color family), saturation (intensity or purity), and lightness (how light or dark). Adjusting these properties lets you create variations of any color for different purposes.

## Warm and Cool Colors

Warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) advance visually and create energy. Cool colors (blues, greens, purples) recede and create calm. Balancing warm and cool colors creates visual depth.
